## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Isabella Alfaro, a junior studying computer science at Queens College. I'm passionate about human-robot interaction, AI, and using technology to solve real-world problems. Currently, Iâ€™m part of Break Through Tech AI, working on AI-driven projects.

## AI Studio Challenge Project
ASAPP Machine Learning Challenge Project (Break Through Tech AI Program):  
Check out my team's project repository for the real-world ML project we worked on for ASAPP during the Fall 2024 AI Studio program!

### My Contributions:
- Processed raw JSON files containing conversation logs, enhancing data clarity by mapping abstract "targets" to human-readable labels, such as converting "return_size" to "Process Return."
- Identified and documented metadata such as null values and numerical fields in "targets" arrays, highlighting their potential relevance for analysis.
- Contributed to schema validation efforts to ensure data outputs adhered to predefined formats.
- Enhanced the preprocessing pipeline by cleaning noisy data and standardizing input formats for consistency across models.
### Key Findings and Results:
- Top Performance: GPT-4 (Few-Shot) achieved an F1 score of 0.9967, making it the most accurate and comprehensive model for structured data extraction.
- Model Comparisons: Larger models (e.g., GPT-4, Gemma2 9B) outperformed smaller ones in precision and recall, especially in zero-shot and few-shot prompting tasks.
- Prompting Techniques: Few-shot prompting consistently yielded the best results, outperforming Chain of Thought (CoT) and zero-shot techniques.
- Efficiency vs. Performance: Mid-sized models like Gemma2 2B offered a balance between computational efficiency and strong performance, suitable for resource-limited scenarios.
