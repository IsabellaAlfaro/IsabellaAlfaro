This project focused on extracting structured data from conversational logs using advanced NLP techniques.
### My contributions:
  - Processed raw JSON files and mapped abstract "targets" to human-readable labels.
  - Enhanced the data pipeline by standardizing inputs and validating schema adherence.
  - Collaborated on model evaluation using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
