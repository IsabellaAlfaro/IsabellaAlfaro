### My Contributions:
- Processed raw JSON files containing conversation logs, enhancing data clarity by mapping abstract "targets" to human-readable labels, such as converting "return_size" to "Process Return."
- Identified and documented metadata such as null values and numerical fields in "targets" arrays, highlighting their potential relevance for analysis.
- Contributed to schema validation efforts to ensure data outputs adhered to predefined formats.
- Enhanced the preprocessing pipeline by cleaning noisy data and standardizing input formats for consistency across models.
